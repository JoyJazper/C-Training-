Greetings everyone!
This is a small representation of the c# or c-sharp programming language,
where i am going to implement all the basic techniques and knowledge about c#
It will start from the very beginning so even if you slight knowledge of what programming language is,
you will be able to learn the very depth of c#.
After compleating and studying my material you will be ready to face any question on c sharp.
I also am making it on the process of becoming perfect.
so there might be some errors. Please report to pjk096@gmail.com
Hopefully it might help you reach the same destination or goal as mine.

Joy Kumar
